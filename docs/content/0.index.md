  /Coming up/ Make it antifragile
  #description
  The end goal is to create systems that can tune and adapt themselves. With a natural language interface, you just have to specify what you want to prioritize and the system should optimize itself to respond to your intentions. For example, "can you shape the burst traffic while keeping latency lower than 100 ms"
