# Getting Started

Let's discover **Capy in less than 5 minutes**.

## Install

Get started by **install capy**.

## Setup your repo

```bash
capy setup
```

Type this command under the current directory of your repo on Terminal and it will start to analyze your repo. 

## Start to work with Capy Agent

```bash
capy --command "terraform plan" --option explain | question etc.
```

Capy command allows you to run any command with --comand option and executing it. With --option, you could
connect to copilot agent to question you want to ask about this repo or analyze your current change etc.

## Example
Let's say here is a change you added to your terraform repo.
```bash
terraform {
  required_providers {
    docker = {
      source  = "kreuzwerker/docker"
      version = "~> 3.0.1"
    }
  }
}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
  name         = "nginx"
  keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
  image = docker_image.nginx.image_id
  name  = "tutorial"

  ports {
    internal = 80
    external = 8000
  }
}
```

Then you want to run a **terraform plan** and then see what the change do. Execute the following:
```bash
capy --command "terraform plan" --option explain | question etc.
```

Here is the output of the Capy command.
```bash
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # docker_container.nginx will be created
  + resource "docker_container" "nginx" {
      + attach                                      = false
      + bridge                                      = (known after apply)
      ...
      + ports {
          + external = 8000
          + internal = 80
          + ip       = "0.0.0.0"
          + protocol = "tcp"
        }
    }

  # docker_image.nginx will be created
  + resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
      + id           = (known after apply)
      + image_id     = (known after apply)
      + keep_locally = false
      + name         = "nginx"
      + repo_digest  = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't
guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

The given Terraform plan shows that Terraform will perform the following actions:

1. Create a Docker container named "tutorial" using the "docker_container" resource. 
The container will have various configuration options such as attach, bridge, command, 
container_logs, entrypoint, env, exit_code, hostname, image, init, ipc_mode,
log_driver, logs, must_run, network_data, read_only, remove_volumes, restart,
rm, runtime, security_opts, shm_size, start, stdin_open, stop_signal,
stop_timeout, tty, wait, and wait_timeout. 
Additionally, the container will have a port mapping from external port 8000 to internal port 80 with protocol TCP.

2. Create a Docker image named "nginx" using the "docker_image" resource. 
The image will have various attributes such as id, image_id, keep_locally, and repo_digest.

The plan indicates that there are 2 resources to be added and 
no resources to be changed or destroyed. 
However, it is important to note that this plan was not saved using the "-out" option, 
so running "terraform apply" may not guarantee the exact same actions.
